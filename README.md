## Change Log

* v1.0: Initial release (January 16, 2019)


## Why?
This was created for three reasons: 
1. Square does not charge a monthly fee. So you pay fees as you go.
2. Square is widely used in brick and mortar stores. So small business owners/retailers can manage all of their received payments in one dashboard.
3. Square does not have a module for osCommerce.

## Requirements:
 - PHP 7.1 or higher
 - OpenSSL Extension 
 - osCommerce Online Merchant v2.2 or v2.3
 - SSL installed on your website
 - Square Account (of course)

## Installation Guide
Please follow the steps found in **Installation_Guide.html**
